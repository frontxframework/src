🚀 FrontxFramework
FrontxFramework is a powerful, modern, and lightweight front-end framework built for the next generation of web applications. Designed with performance, simplicity, and flexibility in mind, it combines modular JavaScript architecture, utility-first CSS classes, and advanced loading strategies — all bundled into a single CDN-ready file.

✨ Features at a Glance
⚙️ Component-Based JavaScript Architecture
Structured for scalability, using modern ES6+ syntax and patterns. All components are accessible via a centralized Components object — no need to create new instances manually.

🎨 Utility-First CSS Engine
Similar to Tailwind or Bootstrap, but faster and more customizable. Write readable HTML like class="paddingt:10 bg:#ffcc00" with semantic utilities.

🧠 Smart Lazy Load with IntersectionObserver
Automatically detects when a component is visible in the viewport and initializes it. Drastically improves performance on large pages and SPAs.

📦 Single CDN File – No Dependencies
Get everything (CSS + JS) with one lightweight file. Ideal for simple HTML pages, WordPress themes, or Laravel/React/Vue projects.

🚀 High Performance by Default
Minimal DOM operations, memory-friendly observers, and on-demand activation.

🧩 Reusable & Pluggable UI Components
Easily use or extend modals, accordions, carousels, dropdowns, tooltips, and more.

📚 Beginner-Friendly & Easy to Learn
Human-readable syntax and intelligent defaults make FrontxFramework accessible to developers at all levels.
